## AWS – Regions and Availability Zones
#### What Are Regions?

- Regions are geographic locations where AWS resources are deployed and used.
- The region you select depends on where you want to position your app/stack.
- The recommended approach is to choose the region closest to your target audience.
- Regions are geographically distinct and do not share infrastructure.

#### What Are Availability Zones (AZs)?

- Availability Zones are isolated locations within a Region.
- Each AZ is typically located at least 60 miles apart to ensure isolation.
- Provides higher availability and fault tolerance.
- For higher availability AWS requires at least 2 or more AZs.
